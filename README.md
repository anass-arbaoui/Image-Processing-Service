📘 Project Description

This project focuses on building a backend system for an image processing service, inspired by platforms like Cloudinary.
The service enables users to upload images, apply a variety of transformations, and retrieve processed images in different formats.

It incorporates secure user authentication, image management, and efficient retrieval mechanisms to ensure a scalable and user-friendly experience.

🔐 User Authentication

Sign-Up: Enables users to create a new account.

Log-In: Allows users to securely access their account.

JWT Authentication: Protects API endpoints using JSON Web Tokens for secure and authenticated access.

🖼️ Image Management

Upload Image: Upload and store images on the server.

Transform Image: Apply transformations such as resizing, cropping, rotating, or watermarking.

Retrieve Image: Fetch stored images in multiple formats.

List Images: Display all uploaded images for a user, including relevant metadata.

Resize

Crop
